    "### Overview\n",
    "To investigate and analyse the \"Health Nutrition and Population Statistics\" dataset which attempts to depict the state of human health across the world. This dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics - is provided by https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank. The Content and Context paragraphs (below) are text from the Kaggle overview section.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically the target of this project is to find indicators that are able to predict life expectancy in various groupings of countries around the world, some of these are geographic such as continents or regions and 3 special groupings will also be analysed i.e. 'Fragile and conflict affected situations', 'Heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC)' and 'Least developed countries: UN classification'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "Real data can be messy even when it is not dirty and does not always behave the way you want it to. Specifically in the case of this dataset the values themselves are clean but not all indicators have been collected for every region or country. This is not a surprise as the ability to collect data depends on many factors. Regions and countries range from first world to third world, vast to very small and very many other factors. All of these can have a bearing on what data is available and what has actually been recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving aside the presence or absence of individual indicator data the overriding factor is that many statistical algorithms work better with big data sets, in this project there were only 55 years of data available and a decision was made to reduce the scope to the last 40 years. The data consists of only 1 value per year for each indicator and this data is not always available for every region or country. Therefore the bottom line is that the maximum possible number of values for any one indicator is 40. Some statistical algorithms really struggled with only having 40 values per indicator especially when combined with train/test splitting and trying to perform cross validation of the models with multiple folds. See section '06 Perform Model' for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significant Indicators\n",
    "For the **3 World Bank special groupings** there were 3 indicators that appeared in each of the special groupings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    primary completion rate, female (% of relevant age group)\n",
    "    birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)\n",
    "    adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15-19)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that 'life expectancy' and 'primary completion rate, female (% of relevant age group)' are trending up whilst 'birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)' and 'adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15-19)' go down. Remembering that correlation does not imply causation.\n",

Also the country groupings with the 2 highest 'adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15-19)' have the lowest 'life expectancy'.

A basic exploration was done on the **World** dataset exploring the relationship between 'life expectancy' and some broad indicators. The indicators chosen related to the following keywords, 'undernourished', 'hiv', 'health_expenditure', 'malnutrition', 'overweight', 'immunization', 'sanitation', 'water', 'anemia', and 'unemployment'.\n",

    "\n",
    "Indicators related to population demographics such as 'female population 20-24' were removed, as were indicators related to death, mortality or survival as none of these will help to predict the life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple process resulted in the removal of 116 indicators, see the indicator removal code <a href='./02%20capstone_indicators.ipynb#age_indicators' target='_blank'>here</a>. A side benefit of removing indicators especially when a large number are removed is that it makes it easier to identify indicators that you think may be of relevance to your target, that is it removes some of the fog of analysis. The indicators kept were written into csv files for futher analysis.\n",

    "### Data Cleaning for Country Combinations\n",
    "Further data cleaning was done for any specific country combination chosen to analyse.

This removal of nulls was different to the process referred to in the 'Data Parsing and Subsetting' section above as the indicator is only removed from analysis for that country combination (not all country combinations). This allows for more individualised analysis on individual country combinations and also reflects the fact that the data is not consistently filled across all country combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data cleaning wherever nulls are found they are replaced by the median of the column. Lastly the predictor variables (X) are standardised ready for use by any models chosen and plotted to check for any outliers.

    "\"The Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regression method that involves penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients. By penalizing (or equivalently constraining the sum of the absolute values of the estimates) you end up in a situation where some of the parameter estimates may be exactly zero. The larger the penalty applied, the further estimates are shrunk towards zero. This is convenient when we want some automatic feature/variable selection, or when dealing with highly correlated predictors, where standard regression will usually have regression coefficients that are 'too large'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train and Test - Lasso\n",
    "Prior to running the Lasso it is necessary to split the data into training and testing sets. The reason for this is to avoid overfitting of the model, the model is trained on the training set and is then tested on the testing set to see how accurate it is. Due to the relatively small number of data values (40 years of data) the training and testing sets were split 50/50 rather than the more convential method of assigning the training set a larger proportion of the values.\n",

It has flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and scales better to large numbers of samples, it supports both dense and sparse input. SVR acknowledges the presence of non-linearity in the data and provides a proficient prediction model.\n",

Adjusted R-squared is always smaller than R-squared, but the difference is usually very small unless you are trying to estimate too many coefficients from too small a sample in the presence of too much noise. Specifically, adjusted R-squared is equal to 1 minus (n - 1)/(n – k - 1) times 1-minus-R-squared, where n is the sample size and k is the number of independent variables. Adjusted R-squared bears the same relation to the standard error of the regression that R-squared bears to the standard deviation of the errors: one necessarily goes up when the other goes down for models fitted to the same sample of the same dependent variable.\""
